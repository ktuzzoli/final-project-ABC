## Simulation
# simulate one realization of an outbreak in a single household
# Input: Household size n and immune parameters qc & qh
# Output: The total number of people who eventually got sick (total_infected)

# Defining the Model Parameters
# n (Household Size): How many people live in this house
# "q" stands for the probability of avoiding (escaping) infection
# qh (Household Escape Probability): The probability a susceptible person avoids infection from one infected household member.
# qc (Community Escape Probability): The probability a susceptible person avoids infection from the community.
# max_gen: The maximum number of "generations" (waves of infection) allowed.

# Initialization
# S (Susceptible): We start assuming everyone in the house is healthy but vulnerable (n people)
# I (Infected): Initially, zero people are infected inside the house
# total_infected: A counter to track the final outbreak size.

  # Generation 0: Infection enters from the community
  # Logic: The infection must start somewhere.
  # This first step simulates household members catching the virus from the "community" (outside world).
  # Since qc = Probability of escaping infection from the community
  # 1−qc = Probability of getting infected from the community
  
  # 1: We are running this experiment 1 time for this household.
  # S: The number of trials (people in the house).
  # 1 - qc: The probability of "success" (getting infected) for each person.
  # initial_cases: The number of people who brought the virus home

  # Generation 1+ (Household Transmission Loop)
  # The simulation continues as long as: there are infectious people (I > 0) & there are still healthy people to infect (S > 0)
  # Assume the simulation continues in discrete generations
  # assume people infected in generation t are infectious only for that generation
  # In generation t+1, they are recovered, and the newly infected people become the spreaders

    # Infection attempts are independent. To stay safe, you must escape Person 1 & Person 2 & ...

    # We assume community infection is the initial seed (Generation 0)
    # Subsequent generations are driven by household transmission

    S <- S - new_inf # Remove them from the healthy pool

    gen <- gen + 1 # Advance time
  }

# We use this function in ABC Algorithm to see if a specific pair of (qc,qh) produces "Total Infected" counts that match the real history. 
# If the simulation matches the data, the parameters are accepted as plausible.

## ABC Algorithm
# Prior Distribution
# Assume we know nothing else about qc and qh, so every value between 0 and 1 is equally likely (Uniform)

# The second number represents qh: Household escape probability
